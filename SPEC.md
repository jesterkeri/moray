# Moray — Spec & Resume Checkpoint

_Last updated: session before the morning resume (Monad Spark hackathon build)._

---

## ▶ DEPLOYED (Monad testnet, chain 10143)

**`MorayVault` = `0x12CA0E45F5B227CFe5aCcad2550CA3e91e76caCd`**
Deploy tx `0xa87ed5a41bd1418738ef447a51dd53ec250c24e5673f0af3b10c9c5dfe8dca2f`,
block **45465915**. Verified live by reading the immutables back over RPC:
`minNewPayeeDelay=60, configDelay=120, inheritanceVetoDelay=120,
withdrawDelay=90, reclaimGrace=600`. No owner, no admin — the deployer holds no
privileges over the vault.

Contract **Codex-SHIP'd** (r1→r5, 74 tests green). Frontend **Codex-SHIP'd**
(14 web rounds, all 5 flows). Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MORAY_FROM_BLOCK=45465915` so the
Activity view does not scan from block 0.

### Remaining to submit (by Jul 19 23:59 UTC)

1. Privy app id → `NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID`; add the live origin to Privy's
   allowed domains (this is what gates login, not the onboarding "website" field).
2. Push repo public; deploy `web/` to Vercel; fill the README "Live app" slot.
3. One live on-chain round-trip through the UI (the AI judge checks live data).
4. Demo video < 3 min; submit.

See `BUILD_PLAN.md` for the full day-by-day. Commits are landing in-window.

## What Moray is

**Moray — the self-custodial safe.** Bank-grade protection, you hold the keys.
A focused, self-custodial **smart-contract wallet** for the crypto you can't
afford to lose. No dapp browser, no swaps, no NFT galleries. It does one job
better than anyone: protect the funds inside it.

Positioning (the pitch, not a literal claim): a bank's safety without the bank.
- MetaMask = you control your money, but zero safety (blind/irreversible sends,
  drains, lost keys).
- A bank = safety, but they hold and can freeze your money.
- **Moray = both.** It's safer than MetaMask *because* it's a smart-contract
  wallet (a dumb key can't enforce recall/holds/recovery; a contract can).

**The three ways you lose crypto — Moray closes all three:**
1. Bad/scam send → recallable clearing window + recipient-risk + new-payee hold.
2. Drained by an attacker → kill switch (sweep to safe address).
3. Lost keys / you're gone → Dead Man's Switch heir + on-chain recovery.

Frame it as **the safe for funds you can't afford to lose** (complementary to
MetaMask), NOT "MetaMask killer" (the wallet graveyard — safety alone never
moved anyone; don't oversell to DevRel judges).

## Locked scope

**IN (v1):**
- Vault: deposit; **bank-style withdraw** — instant up to a per-24h
  `instantLimit` (default 0 = everything delayed), larger/over-limit exits become
  delayed recallable/freezable exits. Raising the limit is timelocked; lowering
  is instant. Funds live in the contract (native MON for v1).
- Recallable clearing send under the SAME egress policy as withdraw (no bypass):
  delay = max(requested, new-payee floor if untrusted, large-exit `withdrawDelay`
  if amount > remaining instant allowance); an instant send consumes the shared
  allowance. `untrust` re-arms the floor for a previously-cleared payee.
- Safe-address first-set is instant only while the vault is EMPTY; on a funded
  vault it is timelocked. AND killSwitch requires the safe address to have MATURED
  (`configDelay` after being set), so NO fund-redirecting action is instant. This
  blocks the opportunistic pre-position (stolen signer sets safe=attacker on an
  empty vault and sweeps same-session). **Honest residual (documented):** a
  PATIENT attacker who controls the signer while the vault is empty can set a
  malicious safe, wait out maturity, then sweep once the owner funds — the
  "compromised at setup" hard case. Mitigation is procedural: set the safe address
  and fund from a trusted device; once funded, safe changes are timelocked +
  vetoable.
- `reclaim` returns funds to the sender if a recipient can't receive after a
  grace window (anti-wedge), without breaking recipient finality during grace.
- Beneficiaries: **names/notes off-chain & private** (local for v1); the on-chain
  `cleared[from][to]` flag is the trust half → trusted payee can clear instantly.
- Recipient-risk screen: off-chain read (age, tx count, flagged links, poisoning
  lookalike) → a plain-English verdict that **sizes the clearing window** and
  justifies it. Show a verdict, not a raw tx dump.
- Kill switch (setSafeAddress timelocked + killSwitch sweep).
- Dead Man's Switch (heir + check-in + delayed vetoable inheritance).
- Panic freeze (instant).
- Statement view: reads contract events + local beneficiary labels. "What" =
  spend-by-beneficiary + optional user tags. **No fake auto-categorization.**

**OUT (roadmap, v2):**
- Yield (Morpho) — dependency + mainnet + neobank-crowding. Cut.
- Loans — breaks one-feature focus, most-crowded DeFi, poisons safety identity.
- Subscriptions / recurring payments / approval management.
- CCTP / cross-chain sending — architecturally conflicts with recall (can't
  recall a burn); single-chain on Monad only.
- ERC20 / stablecoin (USD1) support — reasonable near-term, but v1 is native MON.
- Full guardian-based signer key-rotation social recovery.
- Encrypted portable beneficiary sync (names off-device without doxxing).

## Security architecture (LOCKED)

**Signer / auth: Privy embedded wallet.** Email/passkey login, no seed phrase,
no operator custody (TEE + Shamir's Secret Sharing — no single party incl. Privy
holds the full key). Hands each user a secp256k1 EOA → contract verifies normal
EVM signatures (**no P-256 precompile dependency**). Privy officially supports
Monad and **subsidizes all Monad testnet usage**; official `monad-developers`
Privy example repos exist. (Caveat noted: Privy's SSS reconstructs the key inside
the TEE at signing time; non-custodial and fine for our model.)

**Hard rules:**
- Server **never** generates/sees/stores/reconstructs a full user key. Any
  recovery path that routes through the operator = custodial = rejected.
- **Email is an identifier + alert channel ONLY.** It must NEVER be able to add
  or rotate a signer. Signer rotation requires the existing signer or the
  on-chain recovery flow. (Else email takeover = wallet takeover.)
- Recovery is cryptographic (Privy re-auth) or on-chain (safe address / recovery
  contact / heir), never "come to us to prove ownership."
- Fail-closed everywhere; no fallback/placeholder security.

**The load-bearing invariant:**
> **Every powerful (control- or fund-redirecting) change is DELAYED and
> CANCELLABLE by the current owner.** Recovery = "silent-owner fallback," not
> "delayed theft."

Applies to: change safe address, add/remove recovery contact, rotate signer,
inactivity (Dead Man) withdrawal, emergency recovery.
Flow: initiator starts → wallet enters `RecoveryPending` → owner has the full
delay to cancel with the current signer → executes only if the owner stays
silent.

**The three refinements that make the veto real (must build in):**
1. **Notification is load-bearing.** The veto only works if the owner *knows*.
   Every pending delay must alert the owner, and NOT solely by email (an attacker
   controlling email can suppress it). Delay long enough to survive a missed
   alert.
2. **Protective vs powerful.** Delay applies to control/fund-redirecting changes.
   **Panic freeze is INSTANT** (it only stops money leaving, never redirects it).
3. **Per-action delays + gated initiation.** Different delays per action; only
   the *designated* recovery contact/safe address may initiate; rate-limit
   initiations (anti veto-fatigue). Initial setup is instant (only *changes* are
   delayed).
   Honest limit: a fully compromised *live* signer (passkey/device, not email) is
   the hard case — delays buy reaction time; panic + recovery-contact mitigate;
   still far better than a normal wallet (compromised key = instant total drain).
   Don't oversell as unbreakable.

Contract-security checklist to apply (from `references/web3-evm.md`): reentrancy
(guarded), access control on every setter, no unprotected init, safe external
calls, no unbounded panic loop (cap or track pending ids), events for the
statement/audit trail. Adversarial Codex pass on every contract commit.

## What's built vs to-build

**Built:** `src/MorayVault.sol` — COMPLETE. P0 core + all security modules:
deposit, hybrid `withdraw` (instant allowance + delayed exits), `send` under the
SAME unified egress policy (no bypass), `cancel`/`reclaim`, `claim` (owner
self-claim proves life), `untrust`, panic/recovery `freeze`, timelocked
`killSwitch` → safe address (first-set instant only while empty, else timelocked),
config state machine (raise-timelocked/lower-instant for the limit), Dead Man's
Switch with vetoable inheritance, bounded pending-set sweeps, reentrancy guard +
CEI, full events. `test/MorayVault.t.sol` = **68 tests green**. Git commits
in-window. Codex **r1 + r2 done (both FIX-FIRST, all findings addressed)**;
**r3 pending** on the r2 fixes.

**To build (priority):**
- Codex r3 adversarial pass on the r2 fixes → SHIP.
- Deploy to Monad testnet (`withdrawDelay >= minNewPayeeDelay`); wire address into env.
- Frontend: Next.js + Privy, send flow w/ recipient-risk verdict + countdown,
  pending/recall, instant-vs-delayed withdraw, beneficiaries (local names),
  safety (safe addr / recovery / panic / kill / heir / instant limit), statement.
- 3-min demo video; public repo.

**v2 roadmap add:** per-account instant limit is live; a richer tiered/limit UX
and portable encrypted beneficiary sync remain v2 (see OUT list).
